# API Builder

This crate aims to make it easy to build API bindings in Rust. It is inspired by [gitlab](https://plume.benboeckel.net/~/JustAnotherBlog/designing-rust-bindings-for-rest-ap-is) and how they build their API bindings.

For some examples, especially on the macros, view [examples](./api-builder/examples/).

## Note

This is just a draft so far. Any PRs to improve this crate are welcome.
